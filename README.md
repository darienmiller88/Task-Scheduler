## Description

Full stack chat application built using Golang and Postgres in the backend, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the frontend. This is an app for a client requiring a personalized task scheduler for their everyday use. Features I aim to add include:

 - JWT + Google OAuth2 authentication.
 - The ability to set single occuring and re-occuring messages.
 - Text reminders using the Twilio API

 There's more to come!

 ## Installation

```
   cd api
   go build 
   go mod vender //if you desire to have a folder including the dependencies, otherwise ignore
   .\fresh //to restart server on change or
   go run main.go //to run the server normally
```
